# CPPND: Capstone Robber Game

Capstone project of Laura de Jong in the Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program, build upon the snake starter code of Udaciy in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses. [This](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Capstone-Snake-Game) repo was the starter code for this project.


## Instructions

Clone the project repository:
    ```git clone https://github.com/laurasdejong/CppND-Capstone-Robber-Game.git```

Build the project: ```make build```

Run the resulting executable in <your path>/CppND-Capstone-Robber-Game/build: ```./robberGame```

## Gameplay

The goal of this game is to rob as much gold as possible. The game has two modes. First the robber needs to track its target, after which the game switches to robbing-mode then the robber must decide how much to extort. If the robber asks for more than the target can give, the robber kills the target, and influences future income because of decreased 'town income'(thus, targets wil carry less). However, when the target has the amount the robber asks for, only that amount is transferred to the robber. Each n seconds, the robber has to pay a fee to the 'robbers guild'.

The game ends when either the town is empty, the robber is bankrupt, or the robber has earned enough to declare himself 'robber king'.
