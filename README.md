# CPPND: Capstone Robber Game

Capstone project of Laura de Jong in the Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program, build upon the snake starter code of Udaciy in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.
